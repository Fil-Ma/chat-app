# Chat App

Here is presented a web app that provides free online chat rooms for users. The project is developed in [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) library.

A simple server based on Express JS completes the application.

## Installation

To install the project clone the repository and run the command `npm install`. This repo includes an `example.env` file that contains important environment variables for reference. Make sure to create a `.env` file and include all variables found in the `example.env` file, replacing the example values with those specific to your environment/needs.

After you set environment variables you can run the command `npm run build` to bundle the application.

## Running the application

You can run the application from the root directory by executing the following commands from two different CLI:

- first start the server: `npm run start:server`
- then you can start the app: `npm run start:react`
